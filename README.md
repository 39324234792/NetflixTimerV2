# NetflixTimerV2

So My bed is far away from my computer and i like watching netflix while i fall asleep so i needed a way to pause the show when i was about to fall asleep. 
So I made the netflix timer v1 which just pauses it after a certian amount of time, but the problem was if the time ran out early I was stuck.
The speaker i use to hear the show from my bed has volume change buttons so when the timer runs out. it checks the volume and waits and if its the same after 30 seconds
then it pauses the show and if its different it puts on a timer for another 20 minutes and then repeats til its the same.
